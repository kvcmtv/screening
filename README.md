## Roles
- Graphics
- Engineering (video and web)
- Processing (metadata and subtitles)
- On-screen (hosts/announcers, if we're going to be handling that)
- Documentation (to take note of what we did so we don't have to reinvent the wheel every time we want to do something similar)

We can have multiple people in one role or one person fill multiple roles.

## Tasks
Tasks are divided into the following groups:
 - [Graphics](https://github.com/kvcmtv/screening/projects/1)
 - [Engineering](https://github.com/kvcmtv/screening/projects/2)

## Code of Conduct
<details>
<summary>Creator's Code v2. Click to expand.</summary>
We are sentient.  
To be sentient is to be limited.  
In our limitation, we make choices that are unwise or are flawed.

If we make unwise choices because of our limitation,  
we cannot judge others for the same reason.

So, we cannot judge,  
thus we forgive. 

This project and its results are intended as:  
a place of learning,  
a place of understanding,  
a place of teaching,  
a place of sharing,  
a place of creators creating the tools for other creators to create complicated things elegantly.

Be well, Creator. Be well and create.
